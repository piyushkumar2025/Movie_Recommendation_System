# Movie_Recommendation_System
I developed a content-based movie recommendation system using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and machine learning libraries (Scikit-Learn and Surprise) with a dataset of 5,000 movies. The model focused on genre and cast, enhancing accuracy through data analysis, preprocessing, feature selection, and parameter tuning.
